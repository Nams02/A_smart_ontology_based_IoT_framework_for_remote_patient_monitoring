## Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most promising technology in health technology systems. IoT-based systems ensure continuous monitoring in indoor and outdoor settings. Remote monitoring has revolutionized healthcare by connecting remote and hard-to-reach regions. Specifically, during this COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to have a remote monitoring system to assess patients remotely and curb its spread prematurely. This paper pro­ poses a framework that provides the updated information of the Corona Patients in the vicinity and thus provides identifiable data for remote monitoring of locality cohorts. The proposed model is IoT-based remote access and an alarm-enabled bio wearable sensor system for early detection of COVID-19 based on ontology method using sensory 1D Biomedical Signals such as ECG, PPG, temperature, and accelerometer. The proposed ontology-based remote monitoring system analyzes the challenges of encompassing security and privacy issues. The proposed model is also simulated using cooza simulator. ==During the simulation, it is observed that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.33 %, which establishes the efficacy of the proposed model==. The effectiveness of the proposed model is also strengthened by efficient power consumption.

## Summary

### Introduction
Biomedical Signals play an essential role in IoT-based Healthcare monitoring systems
The integration of these different signals allows us to a better healthcare monitoring system and detect other health-related issues.
The application of IoT in the medical domain, referred to as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) paved the way for telemedicine, telecare, and remote health services.
It encompasses the collection of various medical devices, systems, or ap­ plications that can connect to a computer network and further comprising of the collection of health data, its analysis, and transmission through the Internet in consort with connected medical devices and medical applications.
The various IoMT applications in hospitals and clinics include intelligent apps to connect patients and doctors in remote locations

### Objectives
This research paper aims to employ the efficacy of remote moni­ toring to curb the spread of the latest epidemic that has hit the entire world in an unprecedented manner

### Results
The section represents the results obtained from the proposed model’s execution on the simulation environment using contiki-cooja simulator.
The bands are connected to the Micro-controller board that fetches the real-time data through the band and performs accuracy analysis from the computing device.
Once the calculation part is over, the calculated results are forwarded to the base station using a wireless module.
The proposed framework’s efficiency is evaluated in two scenarios, viz.
The accuracy of the results and the network evaluation.
The accuracy of the results measured using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Network evaluation is done using network parameters viz. Transmission power, power consumed in the different modes of the network, and total power.
The detailed result evaluation is divided into the following sections: 6.1.

### Conclusion
IoT solutions in the medical domain provide a seamless environment by monitoring remote patients and providing medical help to distant locations by integrating different 1D biomedical signals into a single domain.
During the COVID-19 pandemic situation, remote patient monitoring has become an absolute necessity as medical services fell short of pharmaceutical help.
This work proposed an IoT ontology-based remote patient monitoring system that can help contain the spread of virus and treatment using sensory 1D Biomedical Signals such as ECG, PPG, temperature, and accelerometer.
The efficiency of the proposed model is validated in terms of accuracy and power consumption.
It is observed that the proposed model is efficient in terms of power consumption.
The obtained accuracy and energy ef­ ficiency establishes the effectiveness of the proposed model

## Contributions
- IoT solutions in the medical domain provide a seamless environment by monitoring remote patients and providing medical help to distant locations by integrating different 1D biomedical signals into a single domain. During the COVID-19 pandemic situation, remote patient monitoring has become an absolute necessity as medical services fell short of pharmaceutical help. This work proposed an IoT ontology-based remote patient monitoring system that can help contain the spread of virus and treatment using sensory 1D Biomedical Signals such as ECG, PPG, temperature, and accelerometer. The research work aims to pro­ vide information regarding Corona Patients/suspected Corona patients in any locality to cohorts (colleagues, family members, visitors etc.). Three leading technologies are used to develop the IoT patient moni­ toring application described in this paper: RFID, microcontrollers, and sensors.<br/><br/>Along with that, the ontology related to COVID-19 may be incor­ porated. Here, the efficiency of the proposed model is validated in terms of accuracy and power consumption. During simulation of the proposed model, it becomes evident that the model gives an accuracy of 96.33 %. Additionally, it is also observed that the proposed model is also efficient in terms of power consumption. The obtained accuracy and energy ef­ ficiency establishes the effectiveness of the proposed model.

## Future work
- The proposed framework and methodology are elaborated in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Results are discussed in Section 6, and Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.
